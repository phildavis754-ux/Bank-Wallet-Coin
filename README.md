 - Bank Wallet Coin -
- Cheaper Home loans
- Cheaper Credit
- Better Storage

- THE COIN -
BWC - 21 billion supply
        1 billion pre release at 10 cents per coin.
- TREASURY RELEASE -
One million coins per every dollar increase of market value.
Or per year if the price goes up more than one dollar per year.
 
 - idea - only release up to 10 billion this century as the coin goes up to $1000.
 - Wait, that part is wrong, not $1000. To release 10 billion = a coin at $10,000. ( i left this in for a smile) 
   :- The Math - 75 years left this century. So that is only 75 million new coins released until the year 2100AD.
   Imagine what our technological lives will be like in 75-100 years from now. Food for thought.
   :- Oh, and further to the math, huh, 20 billion treasury coins at 1 million per year (if the coin goes that high).
   Says that the full release of the remaining 20 billion BWC coins will happen at best in the year...
   (where is my calculator) ... in 20,000 years. That's ,um, star date 22025.
   This year is 2025 plus 20,000 = 22025, yep I think that's right.
Ok how about this? The per year treasury restriction only lasts for the first 5 or 10 years
 and still limited to 1 million per dollar increase. That makes more sense.
Ok what's next?
...   ...   
   What if the coin has no pre-sale?
   What if it lists straight away?
Then, the only BWC coins on market are the ones formated and released from treasury.
We will release them slowly at 10 cents or above only.
   That way a solid foundation is formed for the long journey that the BWC enterprize is begining.
....    ....
   Now, after those fun and games let's find out what this idea is about and is it worth anything.
   We will put aside future star dates and years to far beyond our own to consider
   What is Bank Wallet Coin for. ....

    The Wallet -
   - cold storage wallet vaults
   - online bio-metric hot wallet / bank account / KYC
   - everyday banking wallet card / fiat and crypto linked services.
              - Wallet holders will get annual reports and be informed like shareholders.
              - Having a wallet is like joining a bank and becoming a member. The best of 'de-fi/ce-fi', that's de-centralised/centralised finance.

     The Bank -
  The first 100 million dollars from pre-sale or regular sale are the workhorse engine for revenue growth.
  Compounding yearly to increasse growth projections.

   How Does It Work   -   -
The coin funds / builds the wallet.
The wallet secures your finances for storage and everyday banking.
The bank becomes a financial institution that offers homeloans 2% (approximately) cheaper than many nations major banks.
Smaller loans and credit cards also possible.
The banks income secures the coin as a utility based cryptocurrency.
We make money by lending money.
...    ...    
   How can we be cheaper at providing home loans?
         -   Crowd Sourced Banking  -
 Buying a treasury released coin becomes the money that is lent, profiting the bank and thus the coin.
 Coin holders are considered shareholders. We will aim for 10% administration and 90% working capital for treasury funds.
....    ....    
   The Future -
 The ultimate goal is for future earnings of the bank to reach such a level that dividends can be paid to coin holders.
 If or when, let's say when for this example. When we reach the dividend stage. Coin holders can be paid in BC coins.
 A Bank Coin (BC coin) will be a stable currency to each nation, eg- BC US, BC UK, BC AU, BC NZ etc.
 Dividends will be available through the wallet (which has KYC). It will definately take a few years plus for that one.
 We will also like to open retail outlets in our most popular locations if practical and sustainable.
    ....    ....    
    - Planetary Bank - 
   Presale or regular sale funds of the 100 million dollars is small seed financing for the worlds first
   crowd sourced planetary bank. The worlds first zero layer planetary bank. (which is good for another smile).
   
Planetary bank? Yeah, anywhere home loans are too expensive, we will enter the market and offer 
a more affordable option.
Some places in the world have very low home loan rates. In these nations cryptocurrency holders will use our services more than home loan borrowers.

   Some examples of nations with high home loan intrest rates in early 2025...
     - Mexico        11.6%
     - South Africa  10.5%
     - Brazil        10.4%                             
     - New Zealand    7.1%                         
     - Australia      6.7%                         
     - America        6.3%
.... Bank Wallet Coin = 2% less for your lived in home loan. .. and, 1% less for an investment home loan.
...    ...    .
  - What problems does BWC address -    
     - The Wallet - 
     A cryptocurrency wallet that acts like a centralised bank.
     That means K.Y.C. or know your client applies for biometric security.
     This way your wallets keys can never be lost because you are your keys.
     (if you do lose your keys, we will give you new ones if you can prove you are you)
     
    -  The Bank - 
     Cheaper global home loan availability. 
     Making community financing better and more afordable. 
     Balancing world finances at the community level.

     - The Result - 
     A bank that can charge less in transaction fees and offer cheaper credit
     for homeloans and provide everyday banking.
